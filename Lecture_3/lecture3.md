--> Four people — A, B, C, and D — need to cross a bridge at night.They have only one torch, and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without it.At most two people can cross at a time, and when two people cross together, they must move at the slower person’s speed.
The time each person takes to cross the bridge is as follows:
A → 1 minute
B → 2 minutes
C → 7 minutes
D → 13 minutes

You must determine the minimum total time required for all four people to cross the bridge safely, following the above rules.
